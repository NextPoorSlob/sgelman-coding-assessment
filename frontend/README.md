# Frontend

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for instructions on setting up and running the application.

This directory contains the frontend implementation of the Coding Assessment using React. The frontend is responsible for providing a user interface to interact with the backend APIs and display data to the users.

## TODO
1. Implement better error handling for API requests.
2. Get Jest working for unit tests.
3. Add unit and integration tests for React components.
4. Improve UI/UX design and responsiveness.
5. Add authentication flow to the frontend.
6. Implement state management using Redux or Context API.
